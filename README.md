# Quantized

*Tracking the TheBloke and his awesome work*

I hacked this project in a few hours at the weekend. It is a simple static site 
to list quantized llama models provided by [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke).

I was constantly checking the [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke) page to see if there is any new quantized model. As I have already defined the limits of my machine, I was only interested in specific number of parameters but the huggingface page does not provide any filtering option. So I decided to make this project.

I have used [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to generate the static site and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host it. I have also used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
